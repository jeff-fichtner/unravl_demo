      <h4>Back-End Fun Things</h4>
      <p>We developed our app using a Rails API as our back-end. This allowed us to render all of our content as JSON objects that could be efficiently passed to our front-end and parsed dynamically into d3 and then into Swift for your viewing and playing pleasure.</p>
